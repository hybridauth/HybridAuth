# HybridAuth 2.0.11-dev

HybridAuth enables developers to easily build social applications and tools 
to engage websites vistors and customers on a social level by implementing 
social sign-in, social sharing, users profiles, friends list, activities 
stream, status updates and more. 

The main goal of HybridAuth is to act as an abstract API between your application
and various social apis and identities providers such as Facebook, Twitter, 
MySpace and Google.

## FEATURES 

- HybridAuth makes it easy to authenticate users with a wide variety of 
  well known social networks.
- HybridAuth provides the connected user profiles in a rich, simple and 
  standardized structure across all the social apis.
- Besides authentication, HybridAuth enables you to interact with the 
  social API that the users are connected to in a simple way.
- The complexity of implementing identity providers authentication and 
  authorization protocols are simplified for developers.
- All transactions are completely transparent to the end user.

HybridAuth can be used for many purposes, such as: 

- enabling users to sign-in/sign-up using popular social services;
- allowing users to share their comments, reviews and other activities from
  your site to their friends via social networks;
- building social applications and tools to be integrated on a blog, web
  site, web applications, ERP or CRM, etc.
